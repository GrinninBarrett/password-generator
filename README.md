# Password Generator

This assignment, through modifying and expanding upon starter code, focuses on using JavaScript to create an application allowing users to randomly generate a secure password based on criteria they select. Based on the acceptance criteria, I plan to use prompts to determine the user's criteria, and update the HTML using JavaScript to display the generated password. If possible, I would like to also add an element of HTML content that displays (for confirmation) which criteria the user selected, for their own reference.
